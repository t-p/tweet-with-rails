## tweet with rails
* * *
My goal was to save tweets somewhere in the internet. I use   
parts of my twitter trend app to display germany's trends.  
Authentication is handled by omniauth, which supports a broad  
range of external login providers like Facebook, GitHub, Twitter  
or OpenID. Tweets are saved to Amazons simpleDB. Right now  
only the users timeline is displayed. User separation isn't   
implemented too.  

Check out the running application.
